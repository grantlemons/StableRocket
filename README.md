# Stable Rocket
Arduino code created for my IB Sophomore year Personal Project. My project was to research build and create a large model rocket that would stabilize itself to go streight up.
The approach I used was not very well thought out and instead of using thrust vectoring, I used small adjustable fins.
I never actually got to launch the rocket due to project time limitations and bad weather at the launch site. That being said I learned a lot from this project.

I also don't think the code quite works? Or maybe it was just a problem with my servos?
